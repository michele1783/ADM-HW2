In our repository there are many files: 

**functions.py** in which we have written the useful functions to solve the RQ3, RQ4 and the function *parsedate* to transform the unix timestamps.

**Theoretical Question.pdf** is a pdf file where we have elaborated the Theoretical questions. But we have also added these answers at the end of the notebook. 

**Homework_2.ipynb** is the notebook where we have developed our answers to all the research questions and theoretical questions. We have already runned all the notebook.
