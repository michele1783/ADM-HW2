        "In words, starting from an index **l** of the original array **a**, the algorithm is reversing the position of the first **n** elements of the array. Because of this of course it is required that **l+n** $\\leq$ **len(a)**, otherwise the subroutine **swapList()** will raise an error because of the out-of-range index it loops on. Let describe the algorithm's mechanism. Looking at the code, we can assess how the only part of the code actually changing the position of the array's elements is the subroutine **swapList()**. Given a triplet **(a,l,n)**, once **splitSwap()** is called, it will recursively call himself with an **n** halfed call by call (i.e. **n**$^{(1)}$ =**n/2**, **n**$^{(2)}$ =**n**$^{(1)}/2$, **n**$^{(3)}$ =**n**$^{(2)}/2$ and so on). As we can see in the (Fig.1), after $\\text{log}_2(n)-1$ steps, the function **splitSwap(a,l,2)** will be called: in its execution both **splitSwap(a,l,1)** and **splitSwap(a,l+1,1)** will **return** (being **n**=1), finally allowing the execution of **swaplist(a,l,2)** (that we will call **final-node-subroutine** $\\forall l$) that will exchange the position of the array's elements **a[l]** with **a[l+1]**. Being  **splitSwap(a,l,2)** completed,  **splitSwap(a,l+2,2)** will be called. Similary, at the end of the execution its **final-node-subroutine** will exchange the position of the array's elements **a[l+2]** with **a[l+3]**. Basically the **final-node-subroutines** consider the array (starting from the element $a[l]$) as a sequence of $\\frac{n}{2}$ couples of elements and in each couple they exchange the 1st element with the 2nd one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recalling that **splitSwap(a,l,2)** and **splitSwap(a,l+2,2)** where called in **splitSwap(a,l,4)**, **swapList(a,l,4)** (that we will call **semi-final-node-subroutine**) will finally be executed, exchanging the position of the array's elements **a[l]** with **a[l+2]** and **a[l+1]** with **a[l+3]**. So the role of **semi-final-node-subroutines** is to consider the array (starting from the element $a[l]$) as a sequence of $\\frac{n}{4}$ couples of couples and to exchange the position of the 1st element of the 1st couple with the 1st element of the 2nd couple, and the 2nd element of the 1st couple with the 2nd element of the 2nd couple. Basically, after the execution of all the **final-node-subroutines** and of the  **semi-final-node-subroutines** the position of the 1st group of 4 elements of the original array will be reversed, the same for the 2nd group of 4 elements and so on. We can so climb our recursive function tree from the **final-node-subroutines** up to the top **first-final-node-subroutine** i.e. **swapList(a,l,n)**. We can see the effect of each kind of **subroutine** level over a test array in two examples at (Fig.2,3) recalling that the output of the **first-final-node-subroutine** will be equal to the algorithm's output.\n",
